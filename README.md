=== Overview ===

The Hiking Journal is a place for users to log all their hiking adventures. Why? With all the hikes in Washington State, the developer and her friends often forgot the hikes they conquered, the hikes they loved and the hikes that left them saying, "never again". Inspired by her friend’s diligent recordkeeping of their hikes on a spreadsheet to solve this very problem, the idea of building a digital hiking journal was born.
